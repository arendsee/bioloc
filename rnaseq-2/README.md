# Why 2

Because 1 died.

Why did it die? I built too far without testing. I had no idea where I was
going. I was writing in an incomplete media, writing the rules as I worked,
without understanding their implications. This is the story of Morloc. I need
to throw it out, rewrite, refactor from the beginning.
